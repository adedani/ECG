# ECG
Machine Learning CODE

The ECG train and test file has the model .h5 file that can be implemented.
This files uses the dataset obtained from the kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)

Once you have your .h5 model, it takes (1,187) points of dataset that represent youtr heartbeat.

How to implement this .h5 model is shown in imp.jpynb file.

Plothheart.jpynb gives you the way you can calculate and plot heart rate

ekgdata.c is the arduino code to get the data
